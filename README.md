# Willow DLS Example

This repository contains several examples of Willow tests written in JavaScript.

To get started testing your own circuits, simply
  * clone this repository
  * run `npm install`
  * place any circuits to test in `circuits`
  * place any test files in `tests`
  * run `npm test`

(Note: It is not necessary to place circuits or tests in any particular directory.
Just be sure that the tests uses the correct pathname when loading the circuit.)

See the README in [`willow-dls/core`](https://github.com/willow-dls/core) for more details.
